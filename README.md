# sonos-esp

Basic Arduino code for connecting ESP8266 to Sonos systems.

Right now there is one sketch which provides a web interface for connecting the ESP8266 to a wifi network, and one sketch that just reads the current volume of a Sonos divice.

The two sketches will be integrated into one standalone sonos control device.

## Instructions for connecting to access point

1. Connect the ESP8266 to power, and connect a pushbutton between ground and input pin D6. Internal pullup is used, no external resistor needed
2. The ESP tries to connect to last known network. If it works, the built in led will turn off, but give a short blink every 15th second to indicate it is alive
3. If it does not succed the ESP goes to configure state for two minutes after failed connection attempt. The ESP can also be taken to configure state at any time by pressing the button
4. When the ESP is configure state: The built in led will start blinking 5 blinks per soecond and the ESP is now a wifi access point with SSID=configure
5. Connect a computer to the wifi network "configure"
6. Open a browser and go to http://192.168.4.1
7. Enter ssid and password in webform and connect. The led blinks a  little slower
8. A messege should appear if you succeeded or not.
9. If you succeeded, the ESP leaves configure state and is now connected
10. If you did not succeed you can try again
11. If you pressed the button accidentally, you can press it again to leave configure mode
12. If it the ESP did not succeed in connecting to a network, the built in led will turn on, and give a short blink every  15th second

## LED indication

- OFF with short blink every 15th second: connected
- ON  with short blink every 15th second: not connected
- Blinking 5 blinks per second: ESP in configuration mode. Networks ssid and password can be configured through web browser
- Blinking a little slower: ESP is trying to connect


## Todo

- Test the sonsos discover part with several sonos devices
- Merge sonoscontrol and connecttoaccesspoint into one file
- ~~Enter AP for two minutes after power up to enable configuration without button~~
- ~~Add rotational encoder for volume setting~~
